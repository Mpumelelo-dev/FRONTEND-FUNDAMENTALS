   <h1>Cape Town</h1> 
    <p>Cape Town  is the oldest and second largest city in South Africa, and also the seat of the Parliament of South Africa. Cape Town is a port city on South Africa’s southwest coast, on a peninsula beneath the imposing Table Mountain. Slowly rotating cable cars climb to the mountain’s flat top, from which there are sweeping views of the city, the busy harbor and boats heading for Robben Island, the notorious prison that once held Nelson Mandela, which is now a living museum. </p>
