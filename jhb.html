    <h1>JOHANNESBURG</h1>
    <P>Johannesburg, South Africa's biggest city and capital of Gauteng province, began as a 19th-century gold-mining settlement. Johannesburg boasts a rich, if strangely schizophrenic, cultural life. A visit to Johannesburg is incomplete without a trip to the world-renowned Market Theatre, a multitheatre complex housed in the city’s old produce market. Johannesburgers spend a considerable amount of time outdoors as they are blessed with warm sunny climate.  Its sprawling Soweto township was once home to Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu. Mandela’s former residence is now the Mandela House museum.</P>
